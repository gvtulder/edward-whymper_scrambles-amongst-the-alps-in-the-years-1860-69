					<p>This pass is called usually the Va Cornère. It is also known as the Gra Cornère; which is, I believe, patois for Grand Cornier.

					<p>In 1860, the name of this village was frequently, or usually, written Chamounix or Chamouni. Enquiry has, however, satisfied me that Chamonix is the official and correct form.

					<p>By the lapse of time, some of the remarks in the above paragraphs have become inaccurate. Since the first publication of <i>Scrambles amongst the Alps</i>, Dauphiné has been more frequently visited, and at several of the places that are mentioned in this and in other chapters there is now tolerable accommodation for travellers. A railway has been opened from Embrun to Briançon, with a station at La Bessée, whence a good carriage-road leads up the Val Louise. There are now two hotels at La Ville de Val Louise. The high mountains of Dauphiné are pretty completely explored, and the principal peaks are frequently ascended by tourists. <a href="chapter-2.xhtml#noteref-17" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>M. Puiseux took for guide a man named Pierre Bornéoud, of Claux in the Val Louise, who had accompanied Captain Durand in 1828. In 1861, the expedition of M. Puiseux was quite forgotten in the Val Louise. I am indebted to M. Puiseux for the above and other details. <a href="chapter-2.xhtml#noteref-19" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-20" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>This is a common saying in Dauphiné. It means that there is usually less snow on the mountains during these days than at any other time of the year. The natives have an almost childish dread of venturing upon snow or glaciers, and hence the period of minimum snow seems to them to be the most favourable time for excursions. <a href="chapter-2.xhtml#noteref-20" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Their late préfet shall tell why. “The men and women dress in sheepskins,—which have been dried and scoured with salt, of which the feet are used as clasps, the fore feet going round the neck, and the hinder ones round the loins. Their arms are naked, and the men are only distinguished from the women by the former wearing wretched drawers, and the latter a sort of gown, which only covers them to just below the knees. They sleep without undressing upon straw, and have only sheepskins for coverings. … The nature of their food, combined with their dirtiness, makes them exhale a strong odour from their bodies, which is smelt from afar, and which is almost insupportable to strangers. … They live in a most indifferent manner, or rather they linger in dreadful misery; their filthy and hideous countenances announce their slovenliness and their stink.”—Ladoucette’s <i>Histoire des Hautes-Alpes</i>, pp. 656-7. <a href="chapter-2.xhtml#noteref-25" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The commune of the Val Louise contains at the present time between three and four thousand inhabitants. This crétin population has been aptly described by M. Elisée Reclus in the <i>Tour du Monde</i>, 1860. He said—“They attain the highest possible development of their intelligence in their infancy, and—abundantly provided with majestic goîtres, which are lengthened and swollen by age—are in this respect like to the ourang-outangs, who have nothing more to acquire after the age of three years. At the age of five years the little crétins have already the placid and mature expression which they ought to keep all their lives. … They wear trousers, and coats with tails, and a large black hat.” <a href="chapter-2.xhtml#noteref-29" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>M. Puiseux, on his expedition of 1848, was surprised, when at breakfast on the side of the mountain, by a mass of rock of more than a cubic yard falling like a bomb at his side, which threw up splinters in all directions. <a href="chapter-2.xhtml#noteref-32" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>This mountain is the culminating point of the group, and is named on the French map Pointe des Ecrins. It is seen from the Val Christophe, and from that direction its ridges completely conceal Mont Pelvoux. But on the other side—that is, from the direction of La Bessée or the Val Louise—the reverse is the case: the Pelvoux completely conceals it.</p>
					<p>Unaware that this name was going to be applied to it, we gave the name Pic des Arcines, or des Ecrins, to our summit, in accordance with the traditions of the natives. <a href="chapter-2.xhtml#noteref-33" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>There are three cols or passes close to Monte Viso on its northern side, which lead from the valley of the Po into that of the Guil. The deep notch spoken of above is the nearest to the mountain, and although it is by far the lowest gap in that part of the chain, and would seem to be the true Col Viso, it does not appear to be used as a pass. The second, which I crossed in 1860, has the name Col del Color del Porco given to it upon the Sardinian map! The third is the Col de la Traversette; and this, although higher than at least one of those mentioned above, is that which is used by the natives who pass from one valley to the other. <a href="chapter-2.xhtml#noteref-37" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p><i>Mountaineering in 1861</i>, pp. 86-7. Tyndall and Bennen were mistaken in supposing that the mountain has two summits; it has only one. They seem to have been deceived by the appearance of that part of the south-west ridge which is called ‘the shoulder’ (l’épaule), as seen from Breuil. Viewed from that place, its southern end has certainly, through foreshortening, the semblance of a peak; but when one regards it from the Col Théodule, or from any place in the same direction, the delusion is at once apparent. <a href="chapter-5.xhtml#noteref-100" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The late Principal Forbes was similarly situated while crossing the same pass in 1842. He described the sounds as rustling, fizzing, and hissing. See his <i>Travels in the Alps of Savoy</i>, second ed., p. 323. Dr. R. Spence Watson experienced the same upon the upper part of the Aletsch Glacier in July 1863, and he spoke of the sounds as singing or hissing. See the <i>Athenæum</i>, Sept. 12, 1863. The respective parties seem to have been highly electrified on each occasion. Forbes says that his fingers “yielded a fizzing sound;” and Watson says that his “hair stood on end in an uncomfortable but very amusing manner,” and that “the veil on the wide-awake of one of the party stood upright in the air!” <a href="chapter-5.xhtml#noteref-101" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Those which I collected were as follow:—<i>Myosotis alpestris</i>, Gm.; <i>Veronica alpina</i>, L.; <i>Linaria alpina</i>, Desf.; <i>Gentiana Bavarica</i>, L.; <i>Thlaspi rotundifolium</i>, Gaud.; <i>Silene acaulis</i> L. (?); <i>Potentilla</i> sp.; <i>Saxifraga</i> sp.; <i>Saxifraga muscoides</i>, Wulf. I am indebted for these names to Mr. William Carruthers of the British Museum. The plants ranged from about 10,500 to a little below 13,000 feet, and are the highest which I have seen anywhere in the Alps. Several times this number of species might be collected, I have no doubt, within these limits. Very few lichens are seen on the higher parts of this mountain; their rarity is due, doubtless, to the constant disintegration of the rocks, and the consequent exposure of fresh surfaces. <i>Silene acaulis</i> was the highest plant found by De Saussure on his travels in the Alps. He mentions (§ 2018) that he found a tuft “near the place where I slept on my return (from the ascent of Mont Blanc), about 1780 toises (11,388 feet) above the level of the sea.”</p>
					<p>Mr. William Mathews and Mr. Charles Packe, who have botanised respectively for many years in the Alps and Pyrenees, have favoured me with the names of the highest plants that they have obtained upon their excursions. Their lists, although not extensive, are interesting as shewing the extreme limits attained by some of the hardiest of Alpine plants. Those mentioned by Mr. Mathews are—<i>Campanula cenisia</i>, L. (on the Grivola, 12,047 feet); <i>Saxifraga bryoides</i>, L. and <i>Androsace glacialis</i>, Steud. summits of Mont Emilius, 11,677, and the Ruitor, 11,480); <i>Ranunculus glacialis</i>, L., <i>Armeria alpina</i>, and <i>Pyrethrum alpinum</i>, Willd. (Monte Viso, from 10,000 to 10,500 feet); <i>Thlaspi rotundifolium</i>, Gaud., and <i>Saxifraga biflora</i>, All. (Monte Viso, about 9500 feet); and <i>Campanula rotundifolia</i> L. (?), <i>Artemisia spicata</i>, Jacq., <i>Aronicum Doronicum</i>, Rehb., and <i>Petrocallis Pyrenaica</i>, R. Br. (Col de Seylières, 9247).</p>
					<p>Mr. Packe obtained, on or close to the summit of the Pic de Mulhahacen, Sierra Nevada of Granada (11,600 to 11,700 feet), <i>Papaver alpinum</i>, L. (var. <i>Pyrenaicum</i>), <i>Artemisia Nevadensis</i> (used for giving the flavour to the Manzanilla sherry), <i>Viola Nevadensis</i>, Boiss., <i>Galium Pyrenaicum</i>, Gouan, <i>Trisetum glaciale</i>, Boiss., <i>Festuca Clementei</i>, Boiss., <i>Saxifraga Groenlandica</i>, L. (var. <i>Mista</i>), <i>Erigeron alpinum</i>, L. (var. <i>glaciale</i>) and <i>Arenaria tetraquetra</i>, L. On the Picacho de Veleta (11,440 feet), and the Alcazaba (11,350), the same plants were obtained, with the exception of the first named. At 11,150 feet on these mountains he collected <i>Ptilotrichum purpureum</i>, <i>Lepidium stylatum</i>, and <i>Biscutella saxatilis</i>; and, at 10,000 feet, <i>Alyssum spicatum</i> and <i>Sideritis scordiodes</i>. Mr. Packe says the following plants occur at 9000 to 10,000 feet in the Pyrenees:—<i>Cerastium latifolium</i>, <i>Draba Wahlenbergii</i>, <i>Hutchinsia alpina</i>, <i>Linaria alpina</i>, <i>Oxyria reniformis</i>, <i>Ranunculus glacialis</i>, <i>Saxifraga nervosa</i>, <i>S. oppositifolia</i>, <i>S. Groenlandica</i>, <i>Statice Armeria</i>, <i>Veronica alpina</i>.</p>
					<p>Information on the botany of the Val Tournanche is contained in the little pamphlet by the Canon G. Carrel, entitled <i>La Vallée de Valtornenche en 1867</i>; and a list of the plants which have hitherto been collected on the glacier-surrounded ridge (Furggen Grat) connecting the Matterhorn with the Col Théodule, will be found in Dollfus-Ausset’s <i>Matériaux pour l’étude des Glaciers</i>, vol. viii. part first, 1868.</p>
					<p>In the section of <i>Illustrated Europe</i> upon Zermatt (published at Zurich by Orell Füssli &amp; Co.), Herr F. O. Wolf states that he found several plants in flower on the <i>northern</i> side of the Matterhorn nearly as high as ‘the shoulder.’ <a href="chapter-5.xhtml#noteref-108" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>I have already had occasion to mention the rapid changes which occur in the weather at considerable elevations in the Alps, and shall have to do so again in subsequent chapters. No one can regret more than myself the variable weather which afflicts that otherwise delightful chain of mountains, or the necessity of speaking about it. Its summits appear to enjoy more than their fair share of wind and tempests. Meteorological disturbances, it would seem, are by no means necessary accompaniments of high regions. There are some happy places which are said to be favoured with almost perpetual calm. Take the case of the Sierra Nevada of California, for example, which includes numerous summits from 13,000 to 15,000 feet. Mr. Whitney, of San Francisco, says (in his <i>Guide-book to the Yosemite Valley, and the adjacent region</i>), “At high altitudes, all through the mountains, the weather during the summer is almost always the finest possible for travelling. There are occasional storms in the high mountains; but, in ordinary seasons, these are quite rare, and one of the greatest drawbacks to the pleasure of travelling in the Alps, the uncertainty of the weather, is here almost entirely wanting.” It is probable that a more thorough acquaintance with that region will modify this opinion; for it must be admitted that it is very difficult to judge of the state of the atmosphere at great heights from the valleys, and it often occurs that a terrific storm is raging above when there is a dead calm below, at a distance perhaps of not more than three or four miles. A case of this kind is described in Chapter VII., and another may be mentioned here. At the very time that I was regarding the Dent Blanche from a height of 12,550 feet on the Matterhorn, Mr. T. S. Kennedy was engaged in making the first ascent of the former mountain. He described his ascent in a very picturesque paper in the <i>Alpine Journal</i> (1863). I learn from it that he experienced severe weather. “The wind roared over our ridge, making fearfully wild music among the desolate crags. … It rendered an ordinary voice inaudible,” and “nothing at a distance greater than fifty yards could be seen at all. … Thick mists and driving clouds of snow swept over and past us;” the thermometer fell to 20° Fahr., and his companion’s hair became a mass of white icicles. Now, at this time, Mr. Kennedy was distant from me only four and a half miles. With me, and in my immediate neighbourhood, the air was perfectly calm, and the temperature was agreeably warm; even during the night it fell only two or three degrees below freezing-point. During most of the day the Dent Blanche was perfectly unclouded, though, for a time, light fleecy clouds were hovering about its upper 2000 feet. Still no one would have supposed from appearances that my friend was experiencing a storm such as he has described. <a href="chapter-5.xhtml#noteref-111" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>As it seldom happens that one survives such a fall, it may be interesting to record what my sensations were during its occurrence. I was perfectly conscious of what was happening, and felt each blow; but, like a patient under chloroform, experienced no pain. Each blow was, naturally, more severe than that which preceded it, and I distinctly remember thinking “Well, if the next is harder still, that will be the end!” Like persons who have been rescued from drowning, I remember that the recollection of a multitude of things rushed through my head, many of them trivialities or absurdities, which had been forgotten long before; and, more remarkable, this bounding through space did not feel disagreeable. But I think that in no very great distance more, consciousness as well as sensation would have been lost, and upon that I base my belief, improbable as it seems, that death by a fall from a great height is as painless an end as can be experienced.</p>
					<p>The battering was very rough, yet no bones were broken. The most severe cuts were one of four inches long on the top of the head, and another of three inches on the right temple: this latter bled frightfully. There was a formidable-looking cut, of about the same size as the last, on the palm of the left hand, and every limb was grazed, or cut, more or less seriously. The tips of the ears were taken off, and a sharp rock cut a circular bit out of the side of the left boot, sock, and ankle, at one stroke. The loss of blood, although so great, did not seem to be permanently injurious. The only serious effect has been the reduction of a naturally retentive memory to a very common-place one; and although my recollections of more distant occurrences remain unshaken, the events of that particular day would be clean gone but for the few notes which were written down before the accident. <a href="chapter-5.xhtml#noteref-116" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

We looked aloft and saw in mid-air a solid shot from the Matterhorn describing its proper parabola, and finally splitting into fragments as it smote one of the rocky towers in front. Down the shattered fragments came like a kind of spray, slightly wide of us, but still near enough to compel a sharp look-out.

					<p>I have entered into this matter because much surprise has been expressed that Carrel was able to pass the place without any great difficulty in 1865, which turned back so strong a party in 1862. The cause of Professor Tyndall’s defeat was simply that his second guide (Walter) did not give aid to Bennen when it was required, and that the Carrels <i>would not act as guides after having been hired as porters</i>. J.-A. Carrel not only knew of the existence of this place before they came to it; but always believed in the possibility of passing it, and of ascending the mountain; and had he been leader to the party I do not doubt that he might have taken Tyndall to the top. But when appealed to to assist Bennen (a Swiss, and the recognised leader of the party), was it likely that he (an Italian, a porter), who intended to be the first man up the mountain by a route which he regarded peculiarly his own, would render any aid?</p>
					<p>It is not so easy to understand how Dr. Tyndall and Bennen overlooked the existence of this cleft, for it is seen over several points of the compass, and particularly well from the southern side of the Théodule pass. Still more difficult is it to explain how the Professor came to consider that he was only ‘a stone’s-throw’ from the summit; for, when he got to the end of ‘the shoulder,’ he must have been perfectly aware that the <i>whole height of the final peak was still above him</i>. <a href="chapter-6.xhtml#noteref-123" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>A few days before we crossed the Breuiljoch in 1863, Mr. F. Morshead made a parallel pass to it (which is now called the Furgg Joch). He crossed the ridge on the <i>western</i> side of the little peak, and followed a somewhat more difficult route than ours. In 1865 I wanted to use Mr. Morshead’s pass (see Chap. XV.) but found that it was not possible to descend the Zermatt side; for, during the two years which had elapsed, the glacier had shrunk so much that it was completely severed from the summit of the pass, and we could not get down the rocks that were exposed. <a href="chapter-6.xhtml#noteref-129a" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The summit of the Théodule pass is 10,899 feet above the sea. It is estimated that of late about a thousand tourists have crossed it per annum. In the winter, when the crevasses are bridged over and partially filled up, and the weather is favourable, cows and sheep can still pass over it from Zermatt to Val Tournanche, and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>
					<p>In the <i>middle of August</i>, 1792, De Saussure appears to have taken mules from Breuil, over the Val Tournanche Glacier to the summit of the Théodule; and on a previous journey he did the same, also in the middle of August. He distinctly mentions (§ 2220) that the glacier was completely covered with snow, and that <i>no</i> crevasses were open. Of late years, the glacier has usually been very bare of snow in the month of August, and has had many open crevasses.</p>
					<p>Since 1855, or thereabouts, Zermatt has become one of the most popular Alpine resorts, and it is still growing in favour. Fifty years ago, the Théodule pass, the Weissthor, and the Col d’Hérens were, I believe, the only routes taken from this place across the Pennine Alps. At the present time there are more than two dozen ways by which a tourist may arrive or depart. The summits of some of the Cols are more than 14,000 feet above the sea.</p>
					<p>Down to the middle of the century, the only inn at Zermatt was kept by the village doctor (Lauber). In 1852, Mons. Clemenz opened the Mont Cervin Hotel, and in 1855 M. Alexandre Seiler acquired and extended the original village inn (Monte Rosa Hotel). In 1867 he took over the Mont Cervin Hotel, and afterwards gradually made himself monarch of the place by his enterprise and geniality. The three principal hotels of Zermatt, as well as the Hotel on the Riffelberg (now termed the Riffelhaus), the larger establishment called the Riffel Alp Hotel, and the Hotel at the Lac Noir (Schwarzsee), are all under the control of his family.</p>

					<p>“Here and there on the sides of the glacier it is possible to penetrate between the walls and the ice to a great depth, and even to follow such a gap to the very bottom of the valley; and everywhere do we find the surface of the ice fretted as I have described it, with stones of every size, from the pebble to the boulder, and also with sand and gravel of all sorts, from the coarsest grain to the finest, and these materials, more or less firmly set in the ice, form the grating surface with which, on its onward movement down the Alpine valleys, it leaves everywhere unmistakeable traces of its passage.”—Agassiz, in <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>. <a href="chapter-6.xhtml#noteref-134" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The account of Professor Steenstrup was, I believe, copied many years ago, when he was travelling in Iceland, from an original Icelandic MS. Professor Paijkull, of Upsala, was favoured by Professor Steenstrup with a sight of his MS., and printed some extracts from it in his work, <i>En Sommer i Island</i>, Copenhagen, 1867. The following paragraphs, which refer to this possibly unique occurrence, are taken from the English translation of that work.</p>
					<p>“At the commencement of the eruption a stream burst forth, consisting principally of half-melted snow and large masses of ice, which tumbled about in the sea like floating islands; while, simultaneously, another stream issued in a south-easterly direction, and inflicted great injury on the land. The first of these two streams filled the sea with ice to such an extent that even from the highest mountains it was impossible to see open water till it was broken up by the action of the waves. It then drifted westward as far as Reykjanes, and up into the rivers along the coast, so that large icebergs were left standing in the bed of the river in the Ölfusá. The greater portion, however, of the ice that had been washed down from the glacier remained fixed aground at a distance of about seven miles from land, in a hundred fathoms water. It formed, moreover, a high ridge over the land from the sea as far as Hafrsey, a fjeld on Myrdalssandr. … A stream of similar terrific character broke out on the following day, and submerged the masses of ice that had been previously discharged into the sea, as far as the eye could reach. Further, it made its way through Kerlingar valley, and dammed up the stream there. The deluge, or, more properly speaking, the ice, carried, moreover, immense masses of rock with it; and in the vicinity of Hjörleifshöfdi, a mountain on Myrdalssandr, a rock of twenty fathoms in height, entirely disappeared; not to speak of other instances. One can form some idea of the altitude of this barrier of ice, when it is mentioned that from Höfdabrekka farm, which lies high up on a fjeld of the same name, one could not see Hjörleifshöfdi opposite, which is a fell 640 feet in height; but in order to do so, had to clamber up a mountain slope east of Höfdabrekka, 1200 feet high. The distance between Höfdabrekka and Hjörleifshöfdi is one (Danish) geographical mile, or the fifteenth part of a degree.” <a href="chapter-6.xhtml#noteref-137" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The summit of the Col de Valpelline is about 11,650 feet above the sea. The pass is the easiest one in the Alps of this height, and (if the best route is followed) it may be crossed during fine weather, under favourable circumstances, without cutting a single step. If one does not take the best route, the pass, however, may become a difficult one. Much time and trouble will be saved by strictly adhering to the left bank (eastern side) of the Za-de-Zan (Zadesan) glacier. Mr. Jacomb followed the right bank.</p>
					<p>There is a very fine view from a point that is situated about two-thirds of a mile S. by E. of the summit of the Col. This is marked 3813 mètres=12,410 feet on the map of the Valley of Zermatt. It is connected with the Col by snow-covered glacier at a very moderate angle, and from it one looks well over the Tête Blanche, which is 200 feet less in elevation.

					<p>On p. 11 it is stated that there was not a pass from Prerayen to Breuil in 1860, and this is correct. On July 8, 1868, my enterprising guide, Jean-Antoine Carrel, started from Breuil at 2 A.M. with a well-known comrade—J. Baptiste Bich, of Val Tournanche—to endeavour to make one. They went towards the glacier which descends from the Dent d’Hérens to the south-east, and on arriving at its base, ascended at first by some snow between it and the cliffs on its south, and afterwards took to the cliffs themselves. This glacier they called the glacier of Mont Albert, after the local name of the peak which on Mr. Reilly’s map of the Valpelline is called ‘Les Jumeaux.’ On Mr. Reilly’s map the glacier is called ‘Glacier d’Erin.’ They ascended the rocks to a considerable height, and then struck across the glacier, towards the north, to a small ‘<i>rognon</i>’ (isolated patch of rocks) that is nearly in the centre of the glacier. They passed above this, and between it and the great <i>seracs</i>. Afterwards their route led them towards the Dent d’Hérens, and they arrived at the base of its final peak by mounting a <i>couloir</i> (gully filled with snow), and the rocks at the head of the glacier. They gained the summit of their pass at 1 P.M., and, descending by the glacier of Za-de-Zan, arrived at Prerayen at 6.30 P.M.</p>
					<p>As their route joins that taken by Messrs. Hall, Grove, and Macdonald, on their ascent of the Dent d’Hérens in 1863, it is evident that that mountain can be ascended from Breuil. Carrel considers that the route taken by himself and his comrade Bich can be improved upon; and, if so, it is possible that the ascent of the Dent d’Hérens can be made from Breuil in less time than from Prerayen. Breuil is very much to be preferred as a starting-point. On July 17-18, 1873, Mr. A. G. Puller, with J.-J., J.-P., and E. Maquignaz, and Louis Carrel, ascended the Dent d’Hérens by this route, and descended to Prerayen. <a href="chapter-6.xhtml#noteref-143" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Whilst stopping in the hospice on the Col de Lautaret, in 1869, I was accosted by a middle-aged peasant, who asked if I would ride (for a consideration) in his cart towards Briançon. He was inquisitive as to my knowledge of his district, and at last asked, “Have you been at La Sausse?” “Yes.” “Well, then, I tell you, <i>you saw there some of the first people in the world.</i>” “Yes,” I said, “they were primitive, certainly.” But he was serious, and went on—“Yes, real brave people;” and, slapping his knee to give emphasis, “<i>but that they are first-rate for minding the cows!</i>”</p>
					<p>After this he became communicative. “You thought, probably,” said he, “when I offered to take you down, that I was some poor ⸻, not worth a <i>sou</i>; but I will tell you, that was my mountain! <i>my</i> mountain! that you saw at La Sausse; they were <i>my</i> cows! a hundred of them altogether.” “Why, you are rich.” “Passably rich.

					<p>The ridge called La Meije runs from E.S.E. to W.N.W., and is crowned by numerous aiguilles of tolerably equal elevation.

					<p>In 1869 I carefully examined the eastern end of the ridge from the top of the Col de Lautaret, and saw that the summit at that end could be ascended by following a long glacier which descends from it towards the N.E. into the valley of Arsine. I thought that the <i>highest</i> summit might present difficulties, but was possibly accessible. Since then it has been ascended many times.

					<p>The ascent of the Aiguille de Trélatête from our camp on Mont Suc (2½ hours above the Lac de Combal) and its descent to les Motets, occupied 9½ hours. After quitting the lake, the route led up the largest of the ravines on the S.E. side of Mont Suc, and then along the top of the gently-inclined snow-ridge which was at the summit of that buttress of the Trélatête. It then descended on to a branch of the Glacier d’Allée Blanche, through a gap in one of the minor ridges of Mont Suc. The course was then straight up this glacier (a little W. of N.), until the ridge was struck that descends from the summit of the Trélatête in the direction of Mont Blanc.

					<p>See Forbes’ <i>Occasional Papers on the Theory of Glaciers</i>, pp. 193-95, and <i>Travels through the Alps of Savoy</i>, 2d ed. pp. 86–7, for information bearing upon the mean annual motion of existing Alpine glaciers. In the former work an account is given of the discovery of the remains of a knapsack ten years after it had been dropped in a crevasse, at a horizontal distance of 4300 feet from the place at which it had been lost, showing an average annual motion of 430 feet. In the latter work there is a relation of the recovery of the remains of a ladder used by De Saussure, which had travelled about 13,000 feet in 44 years, or 295 feet per annum. Forbes says that the first of these two examples is better ascertained in all its particulars than the other. It should be observed that the knapsack in question made the descent of the well-known “ice-fall” of the Glacier de Talèfre, and that there was a difference of level between the place at which it was lost and that at which it was found of 1145 feet; that is to say, it descended one foot in every four that it advanced. This rapid descent undoubtedly accelerates the motion of the Glacier de Talèfre. The town of Ivrea, on the other hand, is 768 feet (Ball) above the level of the sea, while Entrèves (at the foot of Mont Blanc) is 4216 feet (Mieulet). So that the glacier which once spread over the sites of these two places (which are about 65 miles apart) descended by an average gradient of almost exactly 1 in 100. This moderate rate of inclination would as certainly tend to retard the motion of the glacier. <a href="chapter-16.xhtml#noteref-291" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The late Principal J. D. Forbes was the first to attach any importance to the veined structure of glaciers. I gather the following definitions of it from different pages of his <i>Occasional Papers</i>. “I cannot more accurately describe it, than by calling it a <i>ribboned structure</i>, formed by thin and delicate blue and bluish-white bands or strata, which appear to traverse the ice in a vertical direction, or rather which, by their apposition, formed the entire mass of the ice. The direction of these bands was parallel to the length of the glacier” (p. 3). “In some parts of the glacier it appears more developed than in others. … It penetrates the <i>thickness</i> of the glacier to great depths. It is an integral part of its inmost structure” (p. 5). “The breadth of these (bands) varies from a small fraction of an inch to several inches” (p. 8). “This structure consists in the alternation of more or less perfectly crystallised ice in parallel layers, often thinning out altogether like veins in marble” (p. 19).</p>
					<p>Forbes’ “veined structure” is frequently cut, both horizontally and vertically, by other veins, which latter seem to me to have clearly a different origin from the former. Proper discrimination has not hitherto been made between the two. Observers sometimes call one, sometimes the other, and sometimes both, the “veined structure.” It would, I think, be convenient and appropriate to term Forbes’ structure “the laminated structure of glacier.” In 1867, upon the surface of a glacier in the Jakobshavn district, North Greenland, I saw three series of veins crossing each other in three different directions, forming a cross-bar or net-work pattern upon the ice.

The best plan I know is that which we adopted on the descent of the Col Dolent, namely, to let one man go in advance until he reaches some secure point. This one then detaches himself, the rope is drawn up, and another man is sent down to join him, and so on until the last. The last man still occupies the most difficult post, and should be the steadiest man; but he is not exposed to any risk from his comrades slipping, and they, of course, draw in the rope as he descends, so that his position is less hazardous than if he were to come down quite by himself. <a href="chapter-20.xhtml#noteref-375" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Upon this subject I refer the reader back to p. 113. If you are out upon an excursion, and find the work becoming so arduous that you have great difficulty in maintaining your balance, you should at once retire, and not imperil the lives of others. I am well aware that the withdrawal of one person for such reasons would usually necessitate the retreat of a second, and that expeditions would be often cut short if this were to happen. With the fear of this before their eyes, I believe that many amateurs continue to go on, albeit well convinced that they ought not. They do not wish to stop the sport of their comrades; but they frequently suffer mental tortures in consequence, which most emphatically do not assist their stability, and are likely to lead to something even more disagreeable than the abandonment of the excursion.

					<p>I remember speaking about pedestrianism to a well-known mountaineer some years ago, and venturing to remark that a man who averaged thirty miles a-day might be considered a good walker. “A fair walker,” he said, “a <i>fair</i> walker.” “What then would you consider <i>good</i> walking?” “Well,” he replied, “I will tell you. Some time back a friend and I agreed to go to Switzerland, but a short time afterwards he wrote to say he ought to let me know that a young and delicate lad was going with him who would not be equal to great things, in fact, he would not be able to do more than fifty miles a-day!” “What became of the young and delicate lad?” “He lives.” “And who was your extraordinary friend?” “Charles Hudson.” I have every reason to believe that the gentlemen referred to <i>were</i> equal to walking more than fifty miles a-day, but they were exceptional, not <i>good</i> pedestrians.</p>
					<p>Charles Hudson, Vicar of Skillington in Lincolnshire, was considered by the mountaineering fraternity to be the best amateur of his time. He was the organiser and leader of the party of Englishmen who ascended Mont Blanc by the Aig. du Goûter, and descended by the Grands Mulets route, without guides, in 1855. His long practice made him surefooted, and in that respect he was not greatly inferior to a born mountaineer. I remember him as a well-made man of middle height and age, neither stout nor thin, with face pleasant—though grave, and with quiet unassuming manners. Although an athletic man, he would have been overlooked in a crowd; and although he had done the greatest mountaineering feats which have been done, he was the last man to speak of his own doings. His friend Mr. Hadow was a young man of nineteen, who had the looks and manners of a greater age. He was a rapid walker, but 1865 was his first season in the Alps. Lord Francis Douglas was about the same age as Mr. Hadow. He had had the advantage of several seasons in the Alps. He was nimble as a deer, and was becoming an expert mountaineer. Just before our meeting he had ascended the Ober Gabelhorn (with old Peter and Jos. Viennin), and this gave me a high opinion of his powers; for I had examined that mountain all round, a few weeks before, and had declined its ascent on account of its apparent difficulty.</p>
					<p>My personal acquaintance with Mr. Hudson was very slight—still I should have been content to have placed myself under his orders if he had chosen to claim the position to which he was entitled. Those who knew him will not be surprised to learn that, so far from doing this, he lost no opportunity of consulting the wishes and opinions of those around him. We deliberated together whenever there was occasion, and our authority was recognised by the others. Whatever responsibility there was devolved upon us. I recollect with satisfaction that there was no difference of opinion between us as to what should be done, and that the most perfect harmony existed between all of us so long as we were together. <a href="chapter-21.xhtml#noteref-385" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

On the northern (Zermatt) side the eastern face affords another route, or any number of routes, since there is hardly a part of it which cannot be traversed! On the southern (Breil) side the ridge alone, generally speaking, can be followed; and when it becomes impracticable, and the climber is forced to bear down to the right or to the left, the work is of the most difficult character. <a href="chapter-21.xhtml#noteref-391" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Very few stones fell during the two days I was on the mountain, and none came near us. Others who have followed the same route have not been so fortunate; they may not, perhaps, have taken the same precautions. It is a noteworthy fact, that the lateral moraine of the left bank of the Furggengletscher is scarcely larger than that of the right bank, although the former receives all the débris that falls from the 4000 feet of cliffs which form the eastern side of the Matterhorn, whilst the latter is fed by perfectly insignificant slopes. Neither of these moraines is large. This is strong evidence that stones do <i>not</i> fall to any great extent from the eastern face. The inward dip of the beds retains the detritus in place. Hence the eastern face appears, when one is upon it, to be undergoing more rapid disintegration than the other sides: in reality, the mantle of ruin spares the mountain from farther waste. Upon the southern side, rocks fall as they are rent off; “each day’s work is cleared away" every day; and hence the faces and ridges are left naked, and exposed to fresh attacks. <a href="chapter-21.xhtml#noteref-392" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Signor Giordano was naturally disappointed at the result, and wished the men to start again. <i>They all refused to do so, with the exception of Jean-Antoine.</i> Upon the 16th of July he set out again with three others, and upon the 17th gained the summit by passing (at first) up the south-west ridge, and (afterwards) by turning over to the Z’Mutt, or north-western side. On the 18th he returned to Breil.</p>
					<p>Whilst we were upon the southern end of the summit-ridge, we paid some attention to the portion of the mountain which intervened between ourselves and the Italian guides. It seemed as if there would not be the least chance for them if they should attempt to storm the final peak directly from the end of the ‘shoulder.’ In that direction cliffs fell sheer down from the summit, and we were unable to see beyond a certain distance. There remained the route about which Carrel and I had often talked, namely, to ascend directly at first from the end of the ‘shoulder,’ and afterwards to swerve to the left—that is, to the Z’Mutt side—and to complete the ascent from the north-west. When we were upon the summit we laughed at this idea. The part of the mountain that I have described upon p. 388, was not easy, although its inclination was moderate. If that slope were made only ten degrees steeper, its difficulty would be enormously increased. To double its inclination would be to make it impracticable. The slope at the southern end of the summit-ridge, falling towards the north-west, was <i>much</i> steeper than that over which we passed, and we ridiculed the idea that any person should attempt to ascend in that direction, when the northern route was so easy. Nevertheless, the summit was reached by that route by the undaunted Carrel. From knowing the final slope over which he passed, and from the account of Mr. F. C. Grove—who is the only traveller by whom it has been traversed—I do not hesitate to term the ascent of Carrel and Bich in 1865 the most desperate piece of mountain-scrambling upon record. In 1869 I asked Carrel if he had ever done anything more difficult. His reply was, “Man cannot do anything much more difficult than that!” See Appendix. <a href="chapter-21.xhtml#noteref-399" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

He was taken totally by surprise. Mr. Hadow slipped off his feet on to his back, his feet struck Croz in the small of the back, and knocked him right over, head first.

Hudson was not so well placed, but he had liberty of motion. The rope was not taut from him to Hadow, and the two men fell ten or twelve feet before the jerk came upon him. Lord F. Douglas was not favourably placed, and could neither move up nor down. Old Peter was firmly planted, and stood just beneath a large rock which he hugged with both arms. I enter into these details to make it more apparent that the position occupied by the party at the moment of the accident was not by any means excessively trying. We were compelled to pass over the exact spot where the slip occurred, and we found—even with shaken nerves—that <i>it</i> was not a difficult place to pass. I have described the <i>slope generally</i> as difficult, and it is so undoubtedly to most persons; but it must be distinctly understood that Mr. Hadow slipped at an easy part. <a href="chapter-22.xhtml#noteref-406" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>See Frontispiece. I paid very little attention to this remarkable phenomenon, and was glad when it disappeared, as it distracted our attention. Under ordinary circumstances I should have felt vexed afterwards at not having observed with greater precision an occurrence so rare and so wonderful. I can add very little about it to that which is said above. The sun was directly at our backs; that is to say, the fog-bow was opposite to the sun. The time was 6.30 P.M. The forms were at once tender and sharp; neutral in tone; were developed gradually, and disappeared suddenly. The mists were light (that is, not dense), and were dissipated in the course of the evening.</p>

					<p>It has been suggested that the crosses are incorrectly figured in the Frontispiece, and that they were probably formed by the intersection of other circles or ellipses, as shown in the annexed diagram. I think this suggestion is very likely correct; but I have preferred to follow my original memorandum.</p>
					<p>In Parry’s <i>Narrative of an Attempt to reach the North Pole</i>, 4to, 1828, there is, at pp. 99-100, an account of the occurrence of a phenomenon analogous to the above-mentioned one. “At half-past five P.M. we witnessed a very beautiful natural phenomenon. A broad white fog-bow first appeared opposite to the sun, as was very commonly the case,” etc. I follow Parry in using the term fog-bow.</p>
					<p>It may be observed that, upon the descent of the Italian guides (whose expedition is noticed upon p. 393, and again in the Appendix), upon July 17th, 1865, the phenomenon commonly termed the Brocken was observed. The following is the account given by the Abbé Amé Gorret in the <i>Feuille d’Aoste</i>, October 31, 1865:—“Nous étions sur l’épaule (the ‘shoulder’) quand nous remarquâmes un phénomène qui nous fit plaisir; le nuage était très-dense du côté de Valtornanche, c’était serein en Suisse; nous nous vîmes au milieu d’un cercle aux couleurs de l’arc-en-ciel; ce mirage nous formait à tous une couronne au milieu de laquelle nous voyions notre ombre.” This occurred at about 6.30 to 7 P.M., and the Italians in mention were at about the same height as ourselves—namely, 14,000 feet. <a href="chapter-22.xhtml#noteref-409" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>This is not the only occasion upon which M. Clemenz (who presided over the inquiry) has failed to give up answers that he has promised. It is greatly to be regretted that he does not feel that the suppression of the truth is equally against the interests of travellers and of the guides. If the men are untrustworthy, the public should be warned of the fact; but if they are blameless, why allow them to remain under unmerited suspicion?</p>
					<p>Old Peter Taugwalder is a man who is labouring under an unjust accusation. Notwithstanding repeated denials, even his comrades and neighbours at Zermatt persist in asserting or insinuating that he <i>cut</i> the rope which led from him to Lord F. Douglas. In regard to this infamous charge, I say that he <i>could</i> not do so at the moment of the slip, and that the end of the rope in my possession shows that he did not do so beforehand. There remains, however, the suspicious fact that the rope which broke was the thinnest and weakest one that we had. It is suspicious, because it is unlikely that any of the four men in front would have selected an old and weak rope when there was abundance of new, and much stronger, rope to spare; and, on the other hand, because if Taugwalder thought that an accident was likely to happen, it was to his interest to have the weaker rope where it was placed.</p>
					<p>I should rejoice to learn that his answers to the questions which were put to him were satisfactory. Not only was his act at the critical moment wonderful as a feat of strength, but it was admirable in its performance at the right time. I am told that he is now nearly incapable for work—not absolutely mad, but with intellect gone and almost crazy; which is not to be wondered at, whether we regard him as a man who contemplated a scoundrelly meanness, or as an injured man suffering under an unjust accusation.</p>
					<p>In respect to young Peter, it is not possible to speak in the same manner. The odious idea that he propounded (which I believe emanated from <i>him</i>) he has endeavoured to trade upon, in spite of the fact that his father was paid (for both) in the presence of witnesses. Whatever may be his abilities as a guide, he is not one to whom I would ever trust my life, or afford any countenance. <a href="chapter-22.xhtml#noteref-419" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

This explains the facility with which they moved over ground which had been found very trying in earlier times. The young woman declared that the ascent (as far as she went) was a trifle, or used words to that effect; if she had tried to get to the same height before 1862, she would probably have been of a different opinion. <a href="appendix-e.xhtml#noteref-440" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
